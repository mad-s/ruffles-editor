## Project page
https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/developable-metamaterials/

## Building the program(s)

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo
make
```

## Running

- `./ruffles_editor`: Launch the main ruffle editor
- `./ruffles_test_springiness`: Test the relationship between stress (force) and strain (deformation)
- `./ruffles_debug_{strip,ruffle,optimization}`: Debug programs to test individual components of the system during development
